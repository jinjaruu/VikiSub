BIG NOTE: This is deprecated solely on the fact of how old it is, I never really got around to making sure it worked
          as well as making it take in URLs. Maybe if/when I feel bored enough I'll look into doing more with this
          assuming there isn't a standard way of downloading subtitles from Viki by then (there might be right now as far as I know).


VikiSub - JSON to SRT for subtitles from Viki
==================

BACKGROUND
==================
So this is something that was made over the course of the
weekend, and at the start of it I knew little to no Ruby at all.

So I was messing around with the Viki.com, and got curious
with how they do their subtitles. After a bit of poking around
in the source code I found where the subtitle files are stored
for each video. They're stored as JSON files with the start/end
times as milliseconds, and well to skip a bunch, this little ruby script/program was made. Many thanks to my friend torque with help on this and Ruby in general.

It's pretty basic at the moment, I plan to do quite a bit with it though. Please also don't go claiming any converted subtitles as entirely your own, as it's thanks to whoever made the translations.

Ruby 1.9.3 (Least that's what I've tested it in)
